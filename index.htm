    <p><span>1.HTML</span>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSSne-bklNuZpgyJ-HoGvBMFOFe0gm0oZM0z-IGzEXhxLCMEnV2" class="center">
        <p>Yeah this is what you will begin with <span>HTML</span>(Hyper Text Mark-up Language)</p>. HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, which was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.
        most atimes there is a misconception as regarding HTML as a programming langusge but i just want to inform you that HTML is <span>NOT!</span> a programming language, 
        it is a <span>MARK-UP  LANGUAGE</span> HTML is tag dependent i.e it is wriitten in tags(Opening and closing Tags) <span>Example</span> <*head><*/head> the tags come in pairs and the closing tag has a "/"
        HTML can be written in a simple text editor EXAMPLE: Visual Studio Code, Sublime-Text, Notepad++ and it can be previewed in a Web Browser, the file should be saved with an extention of <span>.html</span> or <span>.htm</span>

    <!-- html ends -->
    <!-- css -->
    <div id ="container">
        <p><span>2.CSS</span></p>
        <img src="https://www.kindpng.com/picc/m/23-237467_transparent-css3-logo-png-html5-css3-png-download.png" class = "center">
        <p><span>CSS</span>(Cascading Style Sheet)</p> it is a complement to HTML it is used to make the website look more beautiful forinstance 
        HTML is the skeleton of the body and css is the flesh and every other thing that will make the website attractive as you are!! so css is used to style you html webpage
        <span>CSS</span> can be used internally i.e embedding it in your HTML code or it can be used externally by linking it to your <span>HTML</span> file...Nice right!üòÅ. It is saved with an extention of <span>.css</span>
    </div>
    <!-- css ends -->
    <br />

    <div id = "container">
        <p><span>3.JAVASCRIPT</span></p>
        <img src="https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/javascript-logo-png-transparent.png" class="center">
        <p><span>JAVASCRIPT</span> is a multi-purpose programming language it can be used for both server-side and client-side, in is used to add interactions to your website 
            <span>JAVASCRIPT</span> has other frame works and libries Example:<span>node.js</span>, <span>Angular.js</span>, <span>Vue.js</span>... Javascript is a bit more difficult to lean than <span>HTML</span>, and <span>CSS</span> so just know that before time
